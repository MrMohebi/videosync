# VideoSync

VideoSync is a browser extension that makes watching videos together easier.
Any video on a website, as long as it is served with a `<video>` tag (i.e. if
it's not a GIF or a Flash video), should work with VideoSync.

To watch a video with others on VideoSync, make sure that all parties have the
extension installed. Once everyone joins the same room, links can be shared
between members. Then, each member must select the video -- this step is
necessary in order to support websites that have more than one video elements,
such as ads. Finally, everyone can start watching the same video, staying
synchronized each time someone pauses or rewinds the video.
